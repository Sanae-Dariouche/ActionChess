# Action Chess

This project is a modified chess game that [Boubker Elamri](https://github.com/bob96) and I made as part of a school project. 



## Game concept

The game is a normal chess game until a piece attacks the other. The scene then transforms into a 1v1 combat in which the losing piece is the one getting captured.
### Prerequisites
